"""
MLToolbox

A collection of methods for ML / computational statistics / time-series analysis.


This package is organized as follows:

Subpackages:

- anomaly_detection
    A framework for multivariate Gaussian anomaly detection.

- latent_space
    A framework for exploring the latent dimensions of multivariate datasets.


Modules:

- comp_stats
    Common methods of computational statistics.

- keras
    Utility functions to extend Keras/Tensorflow methods.

- sklearn_extensions
    Methods extending Scikit-learn API.

- time_series
    Common methods for time-series statistics.

- training
    Tools for machine learning model training paradigms.
